\section{Statistical Expertise}
\cvitem{}{}Most of my statistical training is in econometrics, with a focus on methods for panel data for continuous and limited outcomes (e.g., random and fixed effects models) and analyses of time-series data (e.g.,  Autoregressive-Moving Average Processes (ARMA), detection and resolution of trending and seasonality processes). Since transitioning into education research, my work has involved estimating treatment effects with observational data and non-equivalent groups. Methods I have used for this purpose include event-study designs, usually paired with matching (e.g. coarsened-exact matching, post-processing using propensity scores with a matching algorithm or inverse probability of selection weighting, and multivariate distance matching). I also regularly fit linear and generalized linear mixed models. An additional area of interest is in psychometrics and assessing measurement validity and reliability, particularly with survey data. I have used \texttt{Stata} and \texttt{WinSteps} to fit IRT models for existing validated instruments and newly developed ones.
